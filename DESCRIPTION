Description: Calculates 3D lacunarity from voxel data. It is designed to be used 
  with LiDAR point clouds to measure the heterogeneity or "gappiness" of 
  3-dimensional structures such as forest stands. It provides fast C++ functions 
  to efficiently convert point cloud data to voxels and calculate lacunarity 
  using different variants of Allain & Cloitre's well-known gliding-box algorithm.
